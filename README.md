Countdown Timer Web Application
This is a simple, modern, and aesthetic web-based Countdown Timer application. It allows users to set a specific date and time in the future, and then it counts down to that moment, displaying the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. It's built as a front-end application using standard web technologies.

Features:
Set Target Date & Time: Users can input their desired future date and time using intuitive date and time pickers.

Real-time Countdown: The timer updates every second, providing a precise and live countdown.

Clear Display: The remaining time is clearly presented in distinct units: Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds.

Completion Notification: A clear message is displayed to the user once the countdown reaches zero.

Aesthetic Design: The application features a clean, modern, and minimalist user interface, enhanced with a custom background image (bgimage.jpg).

Responsive Layout: The design adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing and usability on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the content and defining the elements of the web application.

CSS3: For styling the application, making it visually appealing, and ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For all interactive functionalities, including handling user input, calculating and updating the countdown in real-time, and managing the display messages.
